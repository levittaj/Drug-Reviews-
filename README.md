# Drug-Reviews-
Abstract: 
Every day, people around the world take doctor prescribed medications to help deal with a variety of diagnoses. I have always wondered how a doctor decides what to prescribe. In this project,  I will build machine learning models that “play doctor”! Through utilizing text analytics techniques on patient reviews my models will predict a patient condition and the effectiveness of the treatment (rating). 

Introduction:
In this project, I explore a data-set of over 200,000 drug reviews that was the basis for a recent Kaggle competition. The data set was adapted from the Machine Learning Library at UC Irvine where it was generated through web scraping pharmaceutical reviews . It was first published  in a study that looked at sentiment analysis of drug experiences across multiple facets. Medication feedback from customers is extremely helpful for drug companies, doctors, and pharmacists alike who are interested in knowing what drugs are effective and what their side-effects can be. 

Main research problem(s):
In my early data exploration and visualization, I looked at the most common conditions and best and worst drugs by rating. This resulted in several potential research questions. 

•	What role does sentiment play in the reviews and useful counts of a medication? 

•	Through the use of sentiment analysis, could I identify positive and negative reviews?

•	Furthermore, can I use various classification models, to predict a condition based on reviews? 

•	Lastly, are their topic clusters in the text?
